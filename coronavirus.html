        <h4>As you can see, it does not take long to infect everybody if the speed of interaction is relatively high, which makes intuitive sense. Herein lies the first takeaway: <br>
        The speed at which the virus spreads seems to be dependent most on interaction between individuals, and the number of individuals who each person <br>
        infects (R0).

        <h2>Intermediate Simulation</h2>
        <h4>Now that you have seen a very basic simulation, I want to increase both the accuracy of our model in terms of population, and scale. To make our population more accurate, I've <br>
        added the age distribution of the United States, and accompanying data on mortality due to coronavirus within each age group was also added. Additionally, the number of people in each household was decided based on<br>
        the distribution of household sizes in the US in 2019 (<a href = "https://www.statista.com/statistics/242189/disitribution-of-households-in-the-us-by-household-size/">statista.com</a>)  It is worth noting that men (at least so far) have been <br>
        much more likely to die of coronavirus (<a href = "https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2020/03/19/coronavirus-kills-more-men-than-women/">Washington Post</a>), Different age groups will possess different <br>
        attributes as well, such as older people tending to stay home (although not completely). Once an individual has been infected, they will continue to travel as they have been for up to a week, and then will self quarantine<br>
        In this simulation, basic measures have already been taken by the government in an attempt to<br>
        limit interactions between individuals, and the movement is no longer random. Individuals visit common locations (such as grocery stores or gas stations), and there there will be limited,<br>
        but still some interactions. Due to the size of the population (1000 people), the movement will not be as fluid, and will represent instead a few hours every frame. This is supposed to be a generally<br>
        accurate representation of what moderate social distancing achieves in terms of the spread of the coronavirus.
