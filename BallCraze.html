    <h2>
        The Idea
    </h2>
    <p1 class="tab">
        &emsp;Ball Craze began as a crazy idea during the summer of 2019. I had completed my C++ focused Data Structures
        course, and felt ready to tackle a challenge which would test me, and be rewarding.
        With coding, even more so than most projects (from my perspective), ideas and hours of code get thrown out or
        left behind for new ideas constantly. I had just experienced that the summer before, having bitten off
        more than I could chew by trying to make a fully fledged online multiplayer game. After two months of diligent
        work, I begrudgingly threw it in the back of my Github, where it has been collecting dust ever since.
        But my desire to make a piece of code; a fully fledged piece of software which was completely mine did not leave
        with that endeavour; quite the opposite, after spending another year coding and learning new techniques,
        and vastly improving my abilities as a programmer, I set out, starting towards the end of the summer, to make a
        cross platform mobile game.
        </br>&emsp;I knew I had to set my sights lower than the previous time, but still stretch myself as much as
        possible. I made a document with my goals for the project, the most important being not letting it die and
        getting it published on the app store.
        I wanted to get something out there. So without a plan, I started to brainstorm. I immediately knew I wanted to
        make a simple, aesthetic game, and so with that idea in mind, I opened a Google Document, and spilled my ideas
        onto the page.
        I finally landed on something. It had all the traits I wanted, and combined classic games like brick breaker and
        pong into something totally new.

    <h2>Development</h2>
    <p1 class="tab">
        &emsp;I knew I didn't want to use a GUI or spend any money on a physics engine. I am a
        big believer in open source software, and right away, I found the perfect library called
        <a href="https://www.cocos.com/en/">cocos2d-x</a>, an open source game developement platform. Like I had hoped, it used C++.
        I began work immediately, speeding through tutorials and trying to keep up with the inevitable deadline of the
        beginning of the school year. I opened my github repo, and began committing code.
